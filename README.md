## 📋 Full Function Descriptions

### 🛠 Adaptive Interface

When a user rides into Saint Denis at sunset or stalks a legendary bear in the northern woods, the menu reshapes itself. In towns, you’ll see options like “Disable Lawmen” or “Schedule Night Events.” In the wilds, the menu highlights animal spawns, environmental tweaks, and hunting tools. The goal? *Only ever see what’s relevant.*

### 🤖 AI-Driven Menus

Leverage the OpenAI and Claude APIs built-in—ask for “Spawn a bandit posse near Valentine,” “Make it always dusk,” or “Set up a custom bounty event.” The menu understands your needs, generating configs, settings, or event logic on the fly.

### 🌎 Multi-Language Support

Unlock the wild west in your mother tongue! Instantly swap between available languages—each translation carefully tuned for gamer slang and period flavor.

### 🌩 Rapid Customization

No waiting, no reloads. Click to set weather, teleport to any hideout, trigger rare animal events, or switch NPC allegiances in an instant. Want to summon a downpour over Blackwater, then a rainbow over Rhodes? It’s two clicks away.

### 🎥 Cinematic Enhancements

Toggle Cinematic Camera modes: slow-motion duels, sepia filters, or custom time-of-day for screenshots. Stealth streamers or photo artists, rejoice.

### 🛡️ Safe Save & Rollback System

Every change is tracked—if you want to roll back, browse the easy timeline feature and snapshot-restore. No more ruined save files or lost progress once you start modding.

### 🌈 Unique Extras

Activate “Wildlife Mayhem” (all animals turn aggressive), “Ghost Train” event triggers, or play as any in-game character. Each is crafted for immersive, replayable fun.

## 🧑‍💻 AI API Integrations

- **OpenAI API**: Built-in chat to create, tweak, or debug complex event scripts with natural language.
- **Claude API**: Use Claude’s unique reasoning engine for creative scenario generation, logic chains, and protected scripting.
